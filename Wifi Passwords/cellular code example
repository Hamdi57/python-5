<!--
Sure, here are some ways to optimize the HTML code you provided:

Remove the border attribute from the table tag. This will remove the visible border around the table, which can save a few bytes of code.
Reduce the cellpadding and cellspacing attributes. These attributes control the amount of space between the cells in the table. Reducing these values can also save a few bytes of code.
Use CSS to style the table. This will allow you to control the appearance of the table without having to add any additional HTML code.
Use a responsive CSS framework to make the table responsive to different screen sizes. This will ensure that the table looks good on all devices.
Here is the optimized code:-->

<html>
<head>
<title>HTML TABLE</title>
<style>
table {
  border: none;
  cellpadding: 0;
  cellspacing: 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Age</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ANKUSH</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raman</td>
<td>35</td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
